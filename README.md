Apache Commons Imaging
===================

Apache Commons Imaging (previously Sanselan) is a pure-Java image library.

Documentation
-------------

More information can be found on the [homepage](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-imaging).
The [JavaDoc](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-imaging/javadocs/api-release) can be browsed.
Questions related to the usage of Apache Commons Imaging should be posted to the [user mailing list][ml].

Where can I get the latest release?
-----------------------------------
There is currently no stable release of Imaging. However you can pull the latest SNAPSHOT from the Apache snapshot repository by adding the snapshot repository to your pom.xml:
 
```xml
<repository>
  <id>apache.snapshots</id>
  <name>Apache Development Snapshot Repository</name>
  <url>https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>
  <releases>
    <enabled>false</enabled>
  </releases>
  <snapshots>
    <enabled>true</enabled>
  </snapshots>
</repository> 
```

Then you can use the SNAPSHOT version of Commons Imaging in your pom.xml:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.commons</groupId>
  <artifactId>commons-imaging</artifactId>
  <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
<dependency>
``` 

The last stable release of Sanselan, before it was renamed to Imaging, was 0.97. You may:
+ Download source and binaries from our [download page](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-imaging/download_sanselan.cgi).
+ Pull it from the central Maven repositories:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.commons</groupId>
  <artifactId>commons-sanselan</artifactId>
  <version>0.97</version>
</dependency>
```

Note that Commons Imaging and Commons Sanselan are neither binary nor source compatible.

Contributing
------------

We accept PRs via github. The [developer mailing list][ml] is the main channel of communication for contributors.
There are some guidelines which will make applying PRs easier for us:
+ No tabs! Please use spaces for indentation.
+ Respect the code style.
+ Create minimal diffs - disable on save actions like reformat source code or organize imports. If you feel the source code should be reformatted create a separate PR for this change.
+ Provide JUnit tests for your changes and make sure your changes don't break any existing tests by running ```mvn clean test```.

If you plan to contribute on a regular basis, please consider filing a [contributor license agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).

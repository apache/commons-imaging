VERSION HISTORY

Release 1.0
------------
TBA

Changes in this version include:

New features:
o IMAGING-75:  Added accessor methods for a number of ImageInfo properties. 
o IMAGING-71:  Applied patch contributed by Nicolas Richeton, adding getEXIFThumbnailSize() and getEXIFThumbnailData() methods to JpegImageMetadata. Thanks to Nicolas Richeton. 
o IMAGING-56:  Add support for the ICNS icon format. Thanks to damjan. 
o IMAGING-58:  Add support for PCX, DCX, WBMP, XBM and XPM images. 
o IMAGING-64:  Add support for TIFF files with compression=2, (CCITT Group 3 1-Dimensional Modified Huffman run length encoding). 
o IMAGING-77:  Add a type-safe high-level API for writing TIFF fields. 
o IMAGING-51:  Add TagInfoXpText for fields like XPTITLE, and encode/decode it using UTF-16LE like Windows does. 
o IMAGING-60:  Added support for reading the RGBE / Radiance HDR image format. Thanks to proyal. 
o IMAGING-68:  Add a field to IptcRecord that contains its raw bytes, and a getter for this value. 
o IMAGING-73:  Provide a way to write EXIF data into files using Sanselan.writeImage(). 
o IMAGING-47:  Run a Findbugs analysis on "mvn site". Also audit and fix resource leaks. Thanks to adrian2k7. 
o IMAGING-65:  Provide a way to write the pixel density (DPI) into an image. 
o IMAGING-61:  Include a test utility for timing and memory in project example classes. Thanks to gwlucas. 
o IMAGING-81:  Add more Javadoc to main package. Thanks to gwlucas. 

Fixed Bugs:
o IMAGING-23:  JpegXMPWriter throws NullPointerException. 
o IMAGING-74:  Fixed a couple of platform-dependent paths in the tests.
        Constantized the magic numbers used when guessing formats.  
        Added a test for the format guessing. 
o IMAGING-2:  SanselanGuessFormatTest and SanselanTestConstants use Java 1.5 method String.replace(CharSequence, CharSequence). 
o IMAGING-80:  Sanselan tests fail on Windows. 
o IMAGING-18:  Fix for "JpegImageMetadata getEXIFThumbnail only works on Jpeg thumbnails stored as Tiff images" issue.
        Jpeg thumbnails are read using ImageIO. Thanks to James E-J. 
o IMAGING-48:  JpegImageMetadata getEXIFThumbnail may raise a null pointer exception. 
o IMAGING-52:  Implement dumpImageFile for ICO files and fix a typo. Thanks to damjan. 
o IMAGING-12:  Tiff (exif) tags of type double written in wrong byte order. Thanks to gwlucas. 
o IMAGING-30:  The isTransparent flag is not set on transparent PNGs. Thanks to clement.escoffier. 
o IMAGING-11:  Ignore TIFF entries that have invalid offsets and/or lengths when we are not in strict mode. 
o IMAGING-78:  readDirectory method in TiffReader doesn't gracefully handle exceptions that can be thrown from ByteSource implementations. 
o IMAGING-24:  Search all tags instead of just EXIF tags when parsing TIFF metadata tags, and try to match on directory type as well. 
o IMAGING-21:  Don't allow very large TIFF lengths to be interpreted as negative because they have the highest order bit set. 
o IMAGING-50:  Make JPEG parsing highly resilient: skip all bytes after the end of a segment until the next segment (0xFF followed by non-0xFF). 
o IMAGING-16:  Fix reading ASCII tags in TIFF files. 
o IMAGING-3:  Ignore string differences in our tests when 7 bit unclean TIFF string are copied. 
o IMAGING-41:  Don't redefine BYTE_ORDER_BIG_ENDIAN and BYTE_ORDER_LITTLE_ENDIAN in UnicodeMetricsUTF16. 
o IMAGING-35:  Fixed issue "FieldTypeASCII does not conform to the EXIF specification," identified by Libor Nenadál. 
o IMAGING-31:  Fixed a bug in which gifs have incorrect size information in the the Logical Screen Descriptor.
        This appears to be a bug in how Microsoft Office writes gifs. The Image Descriptor has the correct value. 
o IMAGING-13:  Added checks in ByteSource's getBlock() methods for invalid params. 
o IMAGING-46:  Fixed a possible NPE in Sanselan.getICCProfile pointed out by Jon Weygandt. 
o IMAGING-76:  Improve ICO file support. Thanks to damjan. 
o IMAGING-49:  Preserve the byte range occupied by the Maker Notes, so rewriting it doesn't corrupt it. 
o IMAGING-29:  Read in the full IPTC block before trying to ignore it, so we don't lose our position in the stream. Thanks to alexvigdor. 
o IMAGING-45:  Fix the GIF BitsPerPixel formula in GifImageParser's getImageInfo(). Thanks to pkapoor. 
o IMAGING-39:  Fix various problems with reading and writing EXIF tags. 
o IMAGING-22:  Eliminate or hide public mutable final arrays in the API. 
o IMAGING-43:  If the TIFF rows per strip is not present, assume it is the image length. Thanks to pkapoor. 
o IMAGING-17:  Make BitInputStream sensitive to byte order. Allows 48 BPP TIFF files to load. Thanks to pkapoor. 
o IMAGING-38:  Fix the PhysicalWidthDpi calculation for JPEG images. Thanks to tjoris. 
o IMAGING-19:  Fix reading DPI for TIFF files. Thanks to vvd. 
o IMAGING-44:  Fix reading DPI for PNG files. Thanks to vvd. 
o IMAGING-40:  Add the Software TIFF tag, and get the byte order after reading the first TIFF directory. Thanks to pkapoor. 
o IMAGING-6:  Correct the expected size of the decompressed TIFF image data, and improve sample depth scaling for PNG images. 
o IMAGING-15:  Stop JpegImageMetadata from throwing NPE if the exif field is null. Thanks to pkapoor. 
o IMAGING-67:  Speed up reading paletted TIFF files. Thanks to gwlucas. 
o IMAGING-8:  Allow TIFF fields to change size during encoding. Fix a broken test that assumes they never do. 
o IMAGING-36:  Fix sample usage links on the website. 
o IMAGING-70:  Reduce memory usage when reading TIFF files. Thanks to gwlucas. 
o IMAGING-33:  Fixed the differencing predictor for tiled TIFF images. 
o IMAGING-5:  Update website, fix some broken links and remove old code. 
o IMAGING-69:  Add a streamlined TIFF reader that reduces load time by a factor of 5. Thanks to gwlucas. 
o IMAGING-82:  Fix BMP width and height DPI. Thanks to pkapoor. 
o IMAGING-86:  Fix the lengths for DateTimeOriginal and DateTimeDigitized TIFF/EXIF tags. 
o IMAGING-88:  Method lowerBound in org.apache.commons.imaging.common.itu_t4.T4AndT6Compression has a division error. Thanks to craigkelly.

 * Removed the images from the www.wpclipart.com Public Domain library.
 * Improved the examples illustrating how to change EXIF metadata.

	"""
 * Applied a "Build Improvements" patch from Niall Pemberton:
	"""
	I took a look at the propsed 0.96 relelase and have some suggestions to improve the build:
	 * Add standard manifest entries to jar
	 * Lock down version numbers for maven compiler, surefire and javadoc plugins
	 * generate sources jar for the release
	 * include the RELEASE-NOTES in the binary distribution
	 * include NOTICE/LICENSE files in the javadoc jar
	"""

Release 0.96
------------

 * Updated KEYS file.
 * Added more unit tests around BMP.
 * Added more images to the test image suite.
 * Fixed a bug where errors were being wrongly logged to System.out.
 * Moved the example code into the test source directory, to comply with Maven's standard project layout.
 * Added a couple of images to the sample image library that demonstrate a couple variations on Photoshop/IPTC data.  
 * Fixed a small bug in the IPTC constants introduced while cleaning up the constants.
 * Started shift towards moving field-level parsing into BinaryInputStream and BinaryOutputStream.
 * Fixed a png unit test that used a piece of Java 1.6 syntax.
 * Added unit tests around the new IPTC functionality.
 * Added IPTC remove/update/insert functionality.
 * Rewrote the IPTC parsing support.  
 * Added improved support for reading and writing iTXt, tEXt, zTXt Png chunks.
 	Added a unit test that demonstrates the feature.
 * Found a new regression wherein DeflaterOutputStream needs to be closed.
 * Added the .tar.bz2 distributions back into the maven assembly descriptors.
 * Moved the example/sample code to a new top-level source folder, "example."
 * Replaced dependency on java.util.zip.DeflaterOutputStream, which is only available in Java 1.6.
 * Added a unit test around reading and writing images in every format.
 * We now sort some (but not all) GIF color tables.
 * Applied the BMP "buffer flushing" bug to the PBM reading and writing code.
 * Fixed a regression around flushing the bit buffer when writing BMPs with very small palettes.
 * Removed assumption about DataBuffer type when reading BMPs.
 * When writing a GIF, we now always include a Graphic Control Extension block, even if its not necessary.
 * We are more defensive about missing GCEs.
 * Lastly, we now set a minimum bound on initial code sizes for LZW-compressed Gif image data.
 * Found a regression in writing TIFFs around strip offsets being properly updated.  Not a LZW issue after all.
	Added a few unit tests around this issue.

Apache Commons Imaging
Version 1.0-alpha1
Release Notes

INTRODUCTION

Apache Commons Imaging is a pure-Java image library for reading and writing
a variety of image formats.

For complete information on Commons Imaging, including sample code,
instructions on how to submit bug reports, patches, or suggestions for
improvement, see the Apache Commons Net website:

http://commons.apache.org/imaging/

Please note that the project was previously known as Apache Sanselan,
and has been renamed to Apache Commons Imaging. As part of this rename:

 * the package changed to
     org.apache.commons.imaging
   from
     org.apache.sanselan

 * the main class is now
     org.apache.commons.imaging.Imaging
   and not
     org.apache.sanselan.Sanselan

 * the Maven coordinates are now:
     <groupId>org.apache.commons</groupId>
     <artifactId>commons-imaging</artifactId>
     <name>Commons Imaging</name>
   instead of the old:
     <groupId>org.apache.sanselan</groupId>
     <artifactId>sanselan</artifactId>
     <name>Apache Sanselan</name>

 * the website is
     http://commons.apache.org/imaging
   and not

 * Added the .tar.bz2 distributions back into the maven assembly descriptors.
 * Moved the example/sample code to a new top-level source folder, "example."
 * Replaced dependency on java.util.zip.DeflaterOutputStream, which is only available in Java 1.6.
 * Added a unit test around reading and writing images in every format.

 * We are more defensive about missing GCEs.
 * Lastly, we now set a minimum bound on initial code sizes for LZW-compressed Gif image data.
 * Found a regression in writing TIFFs around strip offsets being properly updated.  Not a LZW issue after all.
	Added a few unit tests around this issue.

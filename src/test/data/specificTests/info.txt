Adding a file to this folder has no effect to any existing test. If you want to
use a just added file you need to add test which uses this file.

For example, this folder can be used to keep images which cause an exception.

bmp/1/monochrome-negative-height.bmp
    Monochrome 4x8 bitmap with negative height value.
    This image was taken from http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IMAGING-162.
    It was attached there by Myroslav Golub.
	
bmp/1/monochrome-positive-height.bmp
    Monochrome 4x8 bitmap with negative height value.
    monochrome-positive-height.xfc is the original file created with "The Gimp 2.8.10".
    monochrome-positive-height.bmp itself was created by exporting the xfc image to bmp
    using the options shown in monochrome-positive-heightBmp_theGimpOptions.png.

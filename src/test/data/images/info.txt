gif/2/test.gif
	Contributed by Holger Veltrup.
	Image is 300x320, but oddly the Logical Screen Width in the Logical Screen Descriptor is 301, not 300.
	This appears to be a bug in how Microsoft Office writes gifs.
	The Image Descriptor has the correct value.

jpg/4/0x00-to-0xFF-between-segments.jpg
	Contributed by Damjan Jovanovic.
	This is a badly corrupted JPEG: 0x00 0x01 ... 0xFF
	is written between each segment. A resilient JPEG
	parser must skip this data, and scan forward
	looking for 0xFF followed by a non-0xFF byte
	which marks the next segment.

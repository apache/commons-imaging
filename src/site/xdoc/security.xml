                Generally, Apache Commons libraries <a href="https://commons.apache.org/security.html#Security_Model">do
                not support possibly-malicious input</a> unless otherwise specified.
            </p>
            <p>
                Processing untrusted image material is supported to some extent: this should never lead to code execution.
                However, this component currently does not guarantee the absence of DoS conditions, and that any
                applications processing untrusted images should be made resilient against memory, CPU and stack exhaustion
                problems. If you encounter specific cases where certain inputs lead to disproportionate resource usage,
                we welcome those as regular (non-security)
                <a href="https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-imaging/issue-tracking.html">issues</a> or
                <a href="https://commons.apache.org/patches.html">contributions</a>.
                If you'd like to participate in putting together general protections against such problems, in particular
                <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IMAGING-379">this issue</a> could be a good start.

<section name="Building from the latest Source">
<p>
  There are two steps to building Commons Imaging from the latest source:
  <ul>
      <li>Check out the latest source from <a href="source-repository.html">Subversion</a></li>
          <ul>
              <li>1. mkdir imaging-snapshot</li>
              <li>2. cd imaging-snapshot</li>
              <li>3. svn checkout <a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons/proper/imaging/trunk/">https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons/proper/imaging/trunk/</a></li>
          </ul>
      <li>Build using <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven 2</a></li>
          <ul>
              <li>1. Install the latest version of Maven</li>
              <li>2. cd imaging-snapshot (if you are not already in the project directory)</li>
              <li>3. mvn -Prc package</li>
              <li>4. The build will be in the "target" folder.</li>
          </ul>
  </ul>

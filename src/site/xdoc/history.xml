  <ul>
    <li>I've begun a overhaul of the codebase in anticipation of becoming an Apache Incubator project.</li>
    <li>I've changed the package names (again) to be org.apache.commons.sanselan.*.</li>

  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Version 0.79 released June 21th, 2007.
  <ul>
    <li>I've fixed that pernicious bug in LZW compression. I've switched the default TIFF compression scheme back to LZW.</li>
    <li>TIFF uses an unusual variation of LZW. For details, see this article. http://www.fileformat.info/mirror/egff/ch09_04.htm</li>
    <li>In this case, the bug was: trailing EndOfInformation codes are sometimes omitted. That is, if a EndOfInformation code is the last code of a block, it may not appear.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Version 0.78 released June 20th, 2007.
  <ul>
    <li>LZW compression is buggy; this only effects writing TIFF. I've switched the default TIFF compression scheme to packbits which performs worse until this can be corrected.</li>
  </ul>
</p>


<p>
  Version 0.77 released June 16th, 2007.
  <ul>
    <li>I've open sourced the last dependency of this project, sharedlib.</li>
    <li>I've also renamed almost all of the package names. Sorry about this; a simple global search and replace should be easy to do.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Version 0.76 released September 16th, 2006.
</p>

<p>
  Version 0.75 released September 5th, 2006.

<section name="Sanselan: a Pure-Java Image Library">

<subsection name="Introduction">

<p>
  This Pure-Java library reads and writes a variety of image formats, including fast parsing
  of image info (size, color space, icc profile, etc.) and metadata.
</p>
<p>
  This library is pure Java. It's slow, consequently, but perfectly portable.
  It's easier to use than ImageIO/JAI/Toolkit (Sun/Java's image support), supports
  more formats (and supports them more correctly). It also provides easy access to metadata.
</p>
<p>
  Although not yet version 1.0, sanselan is working and is used by a number of projects in production.
</p>
<p>
  This project is Open Source; free as in freedom and free as in beer.
  It is available under the ASF (Apache) License. This is a non-viral Open Source license.

<section name="Commons Imaging: a Pure-Java Image Library">

    <p>
      Apache Commons Imaging, previously known as Apache Commons Sanselan, is a library that
      reads and writes a variety of image formats, including fast parsing
      of image info (size, color space, ICC profile, etc.) and metadata.
    </p>
    <p>
      This library is pure Java. Compared to typical image I/O libraries in native code,
      it's more portable, and should be more reliable and more secure against corrupt/malicious
      images, yet still performs reasonably well.
      It's easier to use than ImageIO/JAI/java.awt.Toolkit (Sun/Java's image support), supports
      more formats (and supports them more correctly). It also provides easy access to metadata.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imaging was working and was used by a number of projects in production even before version 1.0.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project is Open Source; free as in freedom and free as in beer.
      It is available under the ASF (Apache) License. This is a non-viral Open Source license.

     <subsection name="Latest Imaging SNAPSHOT">
         <p>There is currently no stable release of Imaging. You may: </p>
         <ul>
             <li>Build Imaging from sources by checking out the source code from the <a href="source-repository.html">SVN repository</a>.</li>
             <li>Pull the latest snapshot from the Apache snapshot repository</li>
             <!--<li>Download <a href="download_imaging.cgi">1.0</a></li>-->
         </ul>

       <p>
         For pulling the latest snapshot via maven you need to add the Apache snapshot repository to your pom.xml:
         <pre>
&lt;repository&gt;
  &lt;id&gt;apache.snapshots&lt;/id&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;Apache Development Snapshot Repository&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;url&gt;https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/&lt;/url&gt;
  &lt;releases&gt;
    &lt;enabled&gt;false&lt;/enabled&gt;
  &lt;/releases&gt;
  &lt;snapshots&gt;
    &lt;enabled&gt;true&lt;/enabled&gt;
  &lt;/snapshots&gt;
&lt;/repository&gt;                      
         </pre>
         Then you can use the SNAPSHOT version of Commons Imaging in your pom.xml:
         <pre>
&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.commons&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;commons-imaging&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;1.0-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
         </pre>
       </p>
     </subsection>
     <subsection name="Final Sanselan Release">
         <p>The last stable release of Sanselan, before it was renamed to Imaging, was 0.97 You may: </p>
         <ul>
             <li>Download <a href="download_sanselan.cgi">0.97</a></li>
         </ul>

         <p>
             Alternatively you can pull it from the central Maven repositories:
             <pre>
&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.sanselan&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;sanselan&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;0.97-incubator&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
             </pre>
         </p>
     </subsection>

     <p>
